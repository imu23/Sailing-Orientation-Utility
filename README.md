# Sailing-Orientation-Utility
UNH Senior Project 2016

Contained is a directory of files that have the most up to date build of the project. Subdirectories of note would be "Database" which contains a "dbLink.py" and "dbConnect.py" file in order to perform database operations. Next the "sensors" directory includes all the processing files as well as the main driving program: "main.py". Also included in this directory are several "readme" files to explain how the current build integrates and works. Finally the "lost" directory contains files that may be useful in the future. "BMP180" contains files that can be used in conjuction with the pressure sensor. "tools" contains useful miscellaneous scripts.
