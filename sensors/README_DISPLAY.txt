The edisplay file is where the sensor data is being displayed. In the edisplay file, it imports the ImageDraw, ImageFont, Image and EPD libraries. The epd is initialized as a global variable and the screen is cleared upon initialization as well. The display_function is to clear the screen again and get the screenâ€™s width and height in order to calibrate coordinates to display the sensor information and title line. The display accesses a class instance variable array to get the data that will be displayed. Based on the scrolling setting the edisplay selects the first half or second half of data to be displayed.
